## FSDEM: Feature Selection Dynamic Evaluation Metric

This repository contains the implementation of the **FSDEM (Feature Selection Dynamic Evaluation Metric)** as proposed in the paper "A Dynamic Evaluation Metric for Feature Selection" by Muhammad Rajabinasab, Anton D. Lautrup, Tobias Hyrup, and Arthur Zimek, presented at the International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP 2024).

### Overview

FSDEM is a novel evaluation metric designed to address the limitations of existing metrics in the field of feature selection. It provides a dynamic approach to evaluate both the performance and stability of feature selection algorithms. The metric is flexible and reliable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in machine learning.

### Usage

You can use the code provided in this repository or install the `fsdem` package from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install fsdem
```
